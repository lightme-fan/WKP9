# WKP9

Hello!

## 1- These are my steps to accomplish this project:
- I buid the html.
- I grab the link from readme.
- I fetch the movie using async and await.
- I display the fetch movie by mapping it.
- I also sort it by the rt-score so that the movies are ranked from the high score to the low score
- I create the dom and append to ul in the html

## What I learn from this ptoject are:
- I have to use async when I fetch the movie
- I also have to use an object which contains the header with accept application/json

Thanks for this project.
